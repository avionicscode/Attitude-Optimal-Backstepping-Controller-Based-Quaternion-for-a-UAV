a hierarchical controller design based on nonlinear Hinfinity theory and backstepping technique is developed for a nonlinear and coupled 
dynamic attitude system using a conventional quaternion based method .I already tried to implement this nonlinear diff equations in Matlab,
but I did not find the same result in the published article so I'am searching for someone who can help me fix my mistakes.
